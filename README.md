# Surfsup

Overview of the analysis: 
I am planning to move to Hawaii permanently by opening up a Surf and Shake Shop to sell icecream and surf equipment to locals living on the island of Oahu. W. Avy, an interested investor, mentioned that previously he invested in a similar  endeavour however it was unsuccessful because the frequent rain caused the shop to go out of business. W. Avy has asked me to run some analysis on weather data from Oahu to understand if the temperature trends would make opening a shop feasible. 

Task delvierable:
Specifically, W. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. This analysis will compare the temperature data between these months, as well as provide recommendations for any additional analysis which would be useful to perform.
