# Surfsup

Overview of the analysis: 
I am planning to move to Hawaii permanently by opening up a Surf and Shake Shop to sell icecream and surf equipment to locals at the island of Oahu. W. Avy, an interested investor, mentioned that previously he invested in a similar  endeavour however it was unsuccessful because the frequent rain caused the shop to go out of business. W. Avy has asked me to run some analysis on weather data from Oahu to understand if the temperature trends would make opening a shop feasible. 

Task delvierable:
Specifically, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, W. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This analysis will compare the temperature data between these months, as well as provide recommendations for any additional analysis which would be useful to perform.

- According to the summary tables above, the mean temperature in June is 74.94 째F, and the mean temperature in December is slightly lower since it is 71.04 째F.
- The maximum temperature between these months is not very different - in June it is 85 째F, and in December it is 83 째F.
- The standard deviation or variation in the temperature values between these months is quite similar - for the month of June it is 3.26, and for December it is 3.75.

Summary
According to the comparision of mean temperatures, maximum tempeartures, and standard deviations between the months of June and December, the temperatures are fairly consistent between the middle of the year and the end of the year. However, I would recommend performing more queries to gather additional weather data for these two months. For instance, it would be useful to learn about percipitation trends. One additional query should examine the percipitation trends for June and December individually to determine how often and how much it rains through out the month. The other query should examine how percipitation trends and summary statistics vary between these months to see if the shop is sustainable year around. It would be unlikely to have much business at the Surf and Shake Shop if it is raining often, therefore an analysis of percipitation trends is necessary to perform.
