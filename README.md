# Surfsup
Planning to mvoe to hawaii permenently by opening a surf and shake shop selling icecream and surf equipment to locals. Made a business plan and invester said previosuly invested but didnt go well because the rain caused the shop to go out of business. Invester is asking to run some analytics on a waether data set he has on the island i would like to open the shop (oahu)

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
